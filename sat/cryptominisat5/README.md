# SAT tests with cryptominisat5 library

cryptominisat is an actively maintained and well documented SAT solver with C++
and python interfaces as well as a command line tool.

The program is available on github: https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat

If you are on Arch, you can install it through pacman. Otherwise, you'll have
to figure it out yourself (I'm not the IT guy).
